This project contains mini Python code snippets on various topics that I have figured out and explored and found to be useful or interesting. The idea is to take up simple yet challenging use cases that we face everyday while using Python and keep a record of the possible ways I have found to deal with them. There is absolutely no end to finding and learning new things everyday, hence this project.

Day 1: load_json_from_file: How to use json.load() and josn.loads() to read and parse JSON data from file into python dictionaries

Day 2: loading_json_with_parameters: How to use the additional parametes in json.load() and json.loads() to make custom changes to the json data at the time of parsing.

Day 3: reduce_in_python: How we can use the reduce() method in python to access data from a multi-level dictionary when a list of the hierarchy of keys are provided

Day 4: decorators: Simple use of decorators in python and how it can be helpful?

Day 5: dictionary_tricks: 3 simple tricks in the way of using python dictionaries that can be really useful.
